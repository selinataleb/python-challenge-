# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll Analysis

## Overview

This project consists of two Python scripts designed to analyze financial and election data. The scripts leverage Python's built-in modules to process CSV files and output summaries of the analysis.

### PyBank

The PyBank script analyzes financial records to calculate:
- Total number of months included in the dataset
- Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Average change in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

### PyPoll

The PyPoll script analyzes election data to calculate:
- Total number of votes cast
- Complete list of candidates who received votes
- Percentage of votes each candidate won
- Total number of votes each candidate won
- Winner of the election based on popular vote
